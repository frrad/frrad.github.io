Here is the deal with Fi + GV (at least as it stood the last time I investigated
it a few years ago)

Fi does some magical VOIP type things with your phone service, but it doesn't
play nice with google voice. so you can't have both google voice and Fi on the
same google account. Also, you can't forward your google voice number to a Fi
number as you would with a normal carrier phone number. (I think there may be
some workarounds for this, but don't remember the specifics).

So there are a few options

## get Fi and transfer your gv number to it
This is actually not a terrible option if you are going to use fi long term as
it has some of the nice features of GV baked in. However, one of the things I
like the most about GV is the flexibility of being able to change plans which
this reduces. You can transfer your number back to GV after leaving Fi, but it's
not the magical seamless process of not changing anything.

##  get fi on a different google account with a different number.
You can have two accounts on your phone and all the texting features of GV will
still work. To make phone calls you can use the "hangouts dialer app" to make
them over data with your GV number or use the native dialer to make them over
non-data with your fi number. This is a sort of ugly split-brain setup, but is
fine esp if you are just using fi short term for i.e. the amazing international
coverage

##  Don't use Fi at all. (this is the one I would choose)
It's actually pretty meh as a plan apart from the international coverage. Plus
all the hassle with GV is not great.

You can find much better value/ $ plans. For instance I currently have the "ATT
Prepaid $50/month plan". It's actually $40/month if you sign up for auto pay and
you get 8G, so as long as you use >2G and <8G/month it beats the Fi plan. If you
don't think you'll use that much data you can find MVNO plans that are "pay for
what you use" in the same way as fi, but for less. ("Ting" is the one that
sticks in my head, but I haven't really researched these plans. They tend to be
relatively expensive per usage and only make sense if you think you won't use
much)
