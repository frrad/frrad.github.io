I tried to buy a ticket on <sncf-connect.com> and was presented with the following error:

![Error Message](/assets/error-message.png)

"No retrieval options available for this journey. Seats on this train cannot be reserved. Select another journey."

Which doesn't really tell you anything. A bit more searching

```json
{
  "title": "CART_NO_DELIVERY_MODE_AVAILABLE",
  "type": "/booking/no-delivery-mode-available",
  "behaviour": "UNRECOVERABLE",
  "details": "No retrieval options available for this journey. Seats on this train cannot be reserved. Select another journey.",
  "description": {
    "message": "No retrieval options available for this journey. Seats on this train cannot be reserved. Select another journey."
  },
  "cause": {
    "title": "Reservation error",
    "type": "/errors/reservation/reservation-error",
    "status": 400
  }
}
```

turns up this page: <https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-be/help/eticket-not-offered>

which is a bit more helpful:
