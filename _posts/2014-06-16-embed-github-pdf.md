Occasionally I find myself wanting to embed a pdf hosted on github in a
website. Usually it's something that I've TeXed up and want to display prettily
on a website. This time it was my CV. Unfortunately trying to embed a pdf with
URL raw.github.com seems to always result in a grey box like the following:

<img src="/assets/2014-6-16.png" width="100%" alt="screenshot of grey box">

As a work around I've placed a copy of the pdf in the assets directory of the
webpage. Embedding from there seems to work no problem but it would be great to
be able to embed right from the source to guarantee that content was up to date.
