Recently I became interested in the best way to allocate rooms/costs between
roommates. A bit of googling turned up this [Freakonomics Blog
Post](https://freakonomics.com/2012/09/10/is-an-auction-the-best-way-to-solve-the-roommaterent-dilemma/)
called "Is an Auction the Best Way to Solve the Roommate/Rent Dilemma?". I'm not
a big fan of the site the blog post was written about - its mechanism is fairly
trivially gamed - but the comments section is a goldmine.

In the course of reading the comments I found the right name for this problem
which allowed me to find the fairly extensive Wikipedia entry on [Rental
Harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rental_harmony).

Interesting comment by "Evan"
