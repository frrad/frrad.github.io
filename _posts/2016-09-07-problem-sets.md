I finally got around to moving my old problems sets from Google Sites to GitHub.

Here are the individual links:

* [*Abstract Algebra* by Dummit and Foote](https://github.com/frrad/algebra-331)
* [*Algorithm Design* by Jon Kleinberg and Ãva Tardos](https://github.com/frrad/algorithms-336)
* [*Principles of Mathematical* Analysis by Walter Rudin](https://github.com/frrad/analysis-321)
* [*Partial Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems with Applications* by Mark Pinsky](https://github.com/frrad/fourier-381)
* [*A First Course in Optimization Theory* by Rangarajan Sundaram](https://github.com/frrad/optimization-368)
* [*Basic Topology* by M. A. Armstrong](https://github.com/frrad/topology-344)
* [*Algebraic Topology* by Allen Hatcher](https://github.com/frrad/algebraic-topology)
* [*Function Theory of a Complex Variable* by Greene and Krantz](https://github.com/frrad/complex-410)

The solutions are of very varied quality, but can't hurt to keep them around.
