Frederick, Stephanie and Zoey had an eventful year. Frederick and Stephanie went diving in Belize and hiked the Inca Trail. Stephanie started a new job at Facebook and competed in another powerlifting competition. Zoey learned the command "can I get a kiss?" and continues to be a good dog. Frederick still enjoys working at Twitch and is hoping to become an expert skiier this winter.
