Tor offers an [eBook of the month club](http://dead.link.com). In return for signing up for a moderate amount of (unsubscribable) spam they send you a DRM free ebook every month. They offer both .epub and .mobi formats. So far the books have been very good too.

I'm planning to keep a list of past eBooks here.
